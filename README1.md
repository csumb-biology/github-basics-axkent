#This is my first github repository!

##I am very excited

I can use markdown to *italicize* and **bold** my text

Also, I can [link] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) to interesting things that I find on the internet

When I get home I am going to:
1. Write some emails
1. Grade a quiz
1. Read a paper
1. Go to bed

```{python}
for i in range(10):
    print i
```

## All about markdown
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.
You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
